REACT is used in this project.
It basically is a JavaScript library that I will use to control what the users see and use on the website.
Great for apps that don't need refreshing to see changes.
Great for using reusing components throughout the project.
npm install react - to install react.
the part where you define the component is where you use typescript i.e. const component () => {
    typescript here
}
in the return () statement you put html syntax code inside.
this project uses tailwindcss to style the website so all CSS is inline instead using a new file.

Vite is also used in the project. It is a frontend build tool and development server which builds the web app.

Node.js stores the data in the backend i.e. sending messages and storing them in database.
